			<h1> Our Beers </h1>
								
				<p>
					Aspire Brewing was founded in 2011 by Jon Reimer and Aaron Samardzich. Currently based in Chicago, Illinois, 
					our vision for Aspire Brewing is rooted in ambitious undertakings that translate into unique craft
					beers that beer connoisseurs and casual drinkers can enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although we are still working on establishing a more professional brewing site, we have been continuously 
					churning out a variety of beers in Jon's apartment on Chicago's northside. With continued perseverance, 
					we hope to professionally launch Aspire Brewing within in the next few years. In the mean time, we'll be 
					perfecting our recipes, undertaking the necessary business logistics, and keeping you updated on our journey 
					through our blog and video posts. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to informing you about our brewery and beers, this web site serves to
					give you a first-hand look into our aspiration to create, own, and operate a microbrewery.
				</p>
